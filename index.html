	 opposition leader Bobi Wine (Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu)
	 delivered a,,virtual address to the 18th Annual Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy.</p>
	<p>Addressing the international community while in hiding 
	following a contested 2026 election, Wine delivered a charged 
	speech highlighting the following key points:<br>
	He asserted that he rightfully won Uganda's 2026 election but was robbed through widespread electoral fraud.<br>
	Wine accused President Yoweri Museveni and his son, Muhoozi Kainerugaba, of leading a corrupt and torturous dictatorship.<br>
	He urged Western governments to stop enabling the regime and called for immediate, sweeping sanctions against Museveni and his inner circle.<br>
	He warned that the impunity of the Ugandan regime could spread beyond its borders if not addressed by the global community.</p>
	<p>This address took place amid a crackdown on his party, the National Unity Platform (NUP), and after a failed attempt to arrest him, forcing him to speak via video rather than in person.</p>"
